## Hey there, welcome to my Github! 👋🏼
I'm Max, an aspiring Frontend Developer from Germany, who lived in Canada, Brazil, South East Asia. Currently I am based in Amsterdam 🌷

- My tech-journey began as a Product Manager at Lemonade, where I learned so much about managing software development 🔮
- However, I always felt, that the devs are doing the actual work, while I can only support by planning, organizing, prioritizing 
- Deeply impressed by the shere magic of my developer colleagues, I decided to learn the noble craft of coding myself 🦄
- I just graduated from a full-stack development bootcamp and ✨ **I'm open to work at the moment** ✨ 🪄
